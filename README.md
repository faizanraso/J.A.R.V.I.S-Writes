# Shopify-OpenAI-Challenge

### Feautures Included: 

1. Ability to select the AI engine being used through a select box
2. Implemented react-query (useMutation) to define a loading state when a prompt is submitted. In this state the submit button is disabled and a loading message is displayed.
3. Used localStorage to save AI responses as well as AI engine selection after the page is closed/refreshed
